# Linear Boxes 

The game where there's boxes and they move in straight lines... for now.
Shoot them to gain points and cash do buy better weapons so you can shoot more of them to make more cash and score more points.
Also there's skins as well so that's a flex.

## Building

This project does not require any external Java libraries so it's very simple setup.
the `res/` folder needs to be marked as a class path folder in whatever IDE you choose to use.

This project is written and compiled using java version 17.0.2, however, it should work for older versions currently.
